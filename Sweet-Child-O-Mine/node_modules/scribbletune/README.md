[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/scribbletune/scribbletune.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.com/scribbletune/scribbletune)

Use simple __JavaScript__ `Strings` and `Arrays` to generate rhythms and musical patterns. Directly use the names of scales or chords in your code to get arrays which you can mash up using Array methods in ways you hadn't imagined before! Create clips of musical ideas and **export MIDI files** which you can import in *Ableton Live, Reason, Garage Band* or any music creation software that accepts MIDI files. You can even use Scribbletune **in the browser** with Tone.js!

### Install

```bash
npm install scribbletune
```
You can even download the [precompiled version of scribbletune](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scribbletune/scribbletune/master/dist/scribbletune.js) right in the browser with a SCRIPT tag. Make sure to pull in Tone.js first however.
